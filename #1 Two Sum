#1 Easy Two Sum

Prompt:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Thoughts:
• Thought of hashmaps first in order to put in the count of the value and index.
• Used enumerate to get index list and value of index


My Solution:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        dict = {}
        
        for index, number in enumerate(nums):
            if target - number in dict:
                return [dict.get(target-number),index]
            dict[number] = index
        return
