104. Easy. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Prompt:
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

My solution:
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        return (1+ (max(self.maxDepth(root.left),self.maxDepth(root.right))))
