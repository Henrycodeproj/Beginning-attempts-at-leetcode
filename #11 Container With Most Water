#11 Medium, Container With Most Water


Prompt:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.




My solution:
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        max_area = 0
        total = len(height)-1
        
        while total >= 0:
            smaller = min(height[left],height[right])
            curr_area = smaller * total
            if curr_area > max_area:
                max_area = curr_area
            if height[right] >= height[left]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
            total -= 1
        return max_area
        
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
