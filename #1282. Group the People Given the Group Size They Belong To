1282 Medium. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.
You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, 
then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].
Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group.
If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.


My Solution: 
class Solution:
    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        dict = {}
        output = []
        for index, element in enumerate(groupSizes):
            if element in dict:
                dict[element].append(index)
            else:
                dict[element] = [index]
                
            if len(dict.get(element)) == element:
                output.append(dict.get(element))
                dict[element] = []
        return output
