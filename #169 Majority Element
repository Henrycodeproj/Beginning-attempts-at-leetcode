169 Easy. Majority Element

Prompt:
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = {}
        maximum = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i not in dic:
                dic[i] =1
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i]+=1
        maximum = max(dic, key=dic.get)
        return maximum
        
 Time Comlexity: O(n) **Linear Time** because we loop through every potential element.
 Space Complexity: O(n) **Linear space** because we may potentially store every element.
