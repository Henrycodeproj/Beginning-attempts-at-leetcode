1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

Prompt: A string is good if there are no repeated characters.
Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.
Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


My solution:
class Solution:
    def countGoodSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if len(set(s[i:i+3])) == 3:
                count += 1
        return count
        
        
 Time Complexity: O(N) linear time because we loop through every character in the string
 Space Complexity: O(1) constant space because no extra space is needed
