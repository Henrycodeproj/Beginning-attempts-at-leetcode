226 Easy. Invert Binary Tree

Prompt:
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def helper(root):
            if not root:
                return
            root.left,root.right = root.right,root.left
            helper(root.left)
            helper(root.right)
            
        helper(root)
        return root
        
Time Complexity: O(n) **Linear Time** because you may have to traverse all of the parents and up to the leaf nodes.
Space Complexity: O(1) **Contant** because there is no extra space needed to traverse an existing tree.
