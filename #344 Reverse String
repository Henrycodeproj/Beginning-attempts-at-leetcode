#344 Easy. Reverse String

Prompt:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[r],s[l] = s[l], s[r]
            l +=1
            r -=1
        return s
        
Time Complexity: O(N/2)? Unsure if this is the correct time complexity because we always stop at the middle of the array.
Space complexity: O(1) **Contant space** because we modified the array in place by swapping elements towards the center.
