#35 Easy. Search Insert Position

Prompt:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

My Solution
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1
        while low <= high:
            middle = (low + high) // 2
            current = nums[middle]
            if current < target:
                low = middle + 1
            elif current > target:
                high = middle - 1
            else:
                return middle
        return low
