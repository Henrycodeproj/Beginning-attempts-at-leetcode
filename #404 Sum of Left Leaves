#404 Easy. Sum of Left Leaves

Prompt:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.
A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.


My Solution:
class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        list = []
        self.visit(root,list)
        return sum(list)
        
    def visit(self, root,list):
        if not root:
            return
        if root.left and root.left.left is None and root.left.right is None:
            list.append(root.left.val)
        self.visit(root.left, list)
        self.visit(root.right, list)
        
        
Time complexity:O(n) Linear Time. We will traverse the whole tree which is an input of o(n)
Space Complexity:O(log(n)) Log space. Although we are traversing the tree, we are only storing left leaf nodes making it log(n)
