#448 Easy. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Prompt:
Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums.sort()
        list =[]
        a=set(nums)
        for i in range(1, len(nums)+1):
            if i not in a:
                list.append(i)
        return list
        
        
       
 Time Complexity:O(N) Linear Space because we only traverse the length of the array.
 Space Complexity O(N) Linear Space because converting an existing list with set which at worse may need to store every item to the set
