#48 Medium. Rotate Image

Prompt:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        length=len(matrix)
        matrix.reverse()
        for i in range(length):
            for j in range(i):
                matrix[i][j],matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        return matrix
