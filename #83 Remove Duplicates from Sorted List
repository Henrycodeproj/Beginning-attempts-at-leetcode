class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        view = head
        if view is None:
            return
        while view.next:
            if view.val == view.next.val :
                view.next = view.next.next
            else:
                view = view.next
        return head
