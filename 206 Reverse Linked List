#206 Easy. Reverse Linked List

Prompt:
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, 
and return the reversed list.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        current = head
        prev = None
        
        while current:
            next = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next
        return prev
        
        
        
Time complexity: O(n) Linear Time.
Space Complexity: O(1) Constant Time.
