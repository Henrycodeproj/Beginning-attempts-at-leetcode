2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array(Medium)

You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.
Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def findLonely(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        output = []
        for i in nums:
            if i not in dic:
                dic[i] = 1
            else:
                dic[i] += 1
            
        for i in nums:
            if (i+1 not in dic) and (i-1 not in dic) and (dic[i] <= 1):
                output.append(i)

        return output
