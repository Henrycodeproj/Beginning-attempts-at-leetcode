739. (Medium) Daily Temperatures

Prompt:
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

My Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        output = [0]*len(temperatures)
        stack = []

        for i in range(len(temperatures)):
            while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                prev_index = stack.pop()
                output[prev_index] = i - prev_index
            stack.append(i)

        return output


Stack DS
Time Complexity: O(n) Linear Time because we are visiting every at most, one time and doing this in one pass. 
Space Complexity: O(n) Linear Space because we may store up to n elements in the output and stack.
