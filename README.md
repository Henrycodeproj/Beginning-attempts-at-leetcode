# Leetcode-Problems
This keeps track of my progress with working through data structure and algorithms.  I will write down my process to how I broke down the algorithms as well as thought the process behind it so I can look back at it for later reference.

Leetcoding is skill that doesn't come natural to me because coding puts my mind into a whole new ball park. Although it's challenging, I'm ready to take on these coding puzzles and am excited to explore algorithms which took years for others to discover.
