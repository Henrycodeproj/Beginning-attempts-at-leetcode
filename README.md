# Leetcode-Problems
This keeps track of my progress with working through data structure and algorithms.  I will write down my thought process as to how I broke down the algorithms and my thought process behind it so I can look back at it for later reference.

Leetcoding is skill that doesn't come natural to me because coding puts my mind into a very different perspective when trying to solve problems. 
It's like solving how many chairs you'll need for a party, but unable to see, so although it's much easier if you could just eyeball it, now you need to rely on new methods on doing so.
